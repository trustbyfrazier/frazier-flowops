This appears to be very similar to the first workflow but focuses more on vector database operations:

What it does:
- Comprehensive guide for setting up and managing vector databases in Supabase
- Demonstrates full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for vector data
- Includes detailed documentation via sticky notes

Key Operations Covered:
- Preparation: Setting up pgvector extension and database schema
- Insertion: Adding documents with embeddings
- Upserting: Updating existing vector records
- Retrieval: Similarity search and Q&A
- Deletion: Removing records (using HTTP requests since n8n lacks native delete)
