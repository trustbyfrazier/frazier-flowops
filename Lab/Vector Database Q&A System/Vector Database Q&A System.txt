This is a document Q&A chatbot that uses Supabase as a vector database:

What it does:
- Creates an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about the book "How To Transform Your Life" by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso
- Processes an EPUB file from Google Drive, converts it to embeddings, and stores them in Supabase
- Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to find relevant content and answer user questions

Key Components:
- Data Ingestion: Downloads EPUB → Text splitting → OpenAI embeddings → Stores in Supabase
- Chat Interface: Webhook-triggered chat that retrieves relevant content and generates answers
- Vector Operations: Insertion, retrieval, and similarity search using OpenAI embeddings
