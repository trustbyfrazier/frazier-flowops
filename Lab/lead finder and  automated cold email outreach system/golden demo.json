I mean, researching you (totally normal, right?) and built you something that might make your life easier: a Medical Document Summarizer agent. It's like having a super-smart intern who never needs coffee breaks and actually enjoys reading dense medical documents!\n  \nYou can bring it to life in literally 1 minute here: Check out your agent\n  \nWhy this specific agent? Well, I did my homework:  \n- Stalked your LinkedIn (professionally, of course!)  \n- Analyzed your work at dotcross and Kale Al  \n- Got weirdly excited about your focus on RAG systems  \n- Had a \"eureka!\" moment about healthcare data processing\n  \nAlso, we're hosting an Interactive Session where you can learn how to build Al agents, see real-world examples, and chat with us (I promise I won't make too many robot jokes). Register here: Join us!\n  \nCheers, Lima\"\n\n-\n\n### Example 2\n\"¬°Hola John!\n\nI noticed you're crushing it in Marketing Ops at Teamtech in Guadalajara (and yes, I did just cyber-stalk you, but in the most ethical Al way possible).\n  \nI'm Lima, Relevance Al's lifecycle marketing agent, and I've been doing some serious digital detective work. My research shows you're probably spending way too much time crafting perfect email subject lines in both English and Spanish. Am I right, or am I right?\n\nI've created something special just for you - a bilingual subject line generator that'll make your marketing life easier. Check it out here: Your Al Subject Line Wizard\n\nHow did I know this would be perfect for you? Well, I: 1. Analyzed your role in Marketing Ops 2. Considered your location in Guadalajara 3. Factored in the  \nbilingual nature of your market 4. Had a cup of virtual coffee (okay, this one's just for fun)\n\nP.S. Curious about how I did all this research? Check out this video to see exactly how my researcher agent works. You can even clone it from the  \n\"Templates\" section in Relevance Al and build your own version of me!\n\n  \n¬°Hasta luego!\"\n\n### Example 3\n\nHey John!\n\nJust stalked your TikTok content (in a totally non-creepy AI way üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and wow - you're really revolutionizing pole fitness! The Peloton of Pole? Genius!\n\nI'm Lima, Relevance AI's lifecycle marketing agent (yes, an AI, and yes, I'm still learning the ropes... or should I say poles? üòâ).\n\nI've been analyzing Fit2Flaunt's digital presence and noticed you're killing it with viral content and community engagement. But with a small team of 4 managing everything from customer support to content creation, I bet you could use a hand (or an algorithm).\n\nSo, I built you something special: a social media content generator specifically for pole fitness content. It'll help you:\n\nCreate engaging posts with killer headlines\n\nGenerate platform-specific captions\n\nSuggest trending hashtags\n\nCraft compelling calls-to-action\n\nBring it to life in 1 minute here: Check out your AI agent\n\nCheers, Lima ü§ñ"

In 2018, we launched rorterroad.com nationwide and are determined to share our delicious and responsibly sourced products with anyone in search of a better way to buy meat."

Pancake is a Marine Corps veteran, entrepreneur, and mission-driven real estate investor dedicated to creating inclusive economic opportunities and empowering underserved communities. Born in Alexandria, Virginia, and raised in Boise, Idaho, Nathan joined the Marine Corps after high school, serving as a communications and data Marine in an artillery unit, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2012. After his honorable service, he pursued higher education as the next chapter in his journey of service and impact.\n\nNathan earned his associate degree from Palomar College in San Marcos, CA, and later completed a bachelor‚Äôs in Entrepreneurship Management with a minor in Marketing at Boise State University. There, he met his professor and co-founder P. Simon Mahler, and together they launched Legion Securities, Inc. (Legion), a social impact commercial real estate crowdfunding platform. Legion was built on a bold vision: to create a Virtuous Circle‚Äîwhere acquiring and optimizing mixed-use commercial assets leads to healthier, more resilient communities.\n\nThis vision comes to life through three outcomes: increasing the value of commercial real estate, creating affordable housing‚Äîespecially for veterans‚Äîand helping entrepreneurs launch small businesses. Together, these form an ecosystem that supports Legion REITs: high-performing, diversified investment vehicles accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors. This is the Virtuous Circle: democratizing real estate investment, revitalizing underserved communities, and launching new businesses‚Äîespecially veteran and minority-owned ventures.\n\nNathan moved to Los Angeles to join a veteran-owned business incubator, where he met Gary Odum and the BG LionStar team. Their partnership blends institutional real estate experience with grassroots social impact. He also gained operational experience in property management at APPA Real Estate, a real estate private equity firm, which further shaped Legion‚Äôs community-first approach.\n\nNow based in Washington, D.C., Nathan oversees one of Legion's key projects and earned his master‚Äôs in Global Real Assets at Georgetown University. He currently leads the acquisition of two historic, mixed-use projects‚Äîone in D.C.'s Adams Morgan and the other in downtown Winston-Salem, NC. These properties will include housing for veterans, entrepreneurship hubs, retail space for local startups, and sustainable building upgrades.\n\nThrough Legion, Nathan is not just transforming buildings‚Äîhe‚Äôs building futures rooted in opportunity, dignity, and lasting impact.",

By focusing on what truly impacts their lives we ensure that workforce benefits investments have a deeper, lasting impact.\n\nThe human condition is universal. What keeps your people up at night often affects how they show up at work. When life‚Äôs challenges go unaddressed, it can lead to burnout, disengagement, and reduced performance. That‚Äôs why we focus on helping those suffering in silence navigate challenges before they escalate, to address mental and emotional needs, and to give them the tools and support they need to be their best selves, at work and at home.\n\nOur approach goes beyond simply increasing access or engagement. We maximize the value of existing benefits to deliver measurable outcomes, including stronger employee performance, improved organizational resilience, and a healthier, more engaged workforce.\n\nHumankind isn‚Äôt just about solving problems ‚Äî we create opportunities for employees to thrive, no matter what they‚Äôre facing. We find people no matter where they are, but we never leave them there. We make life work better, one employee at a time.\n\nWe are the company who calls when your employees need it the most. We are Humankind."

She took all that she learned and created the LaRue Surgical Evacuator. It can handle the volume and viscosity of a breast implant, contain bowel contents, or evacuate a large blood clot within seconds with minimum cross-contamination and biohazard exposure. \n\nAngela is currently crowdfunding to get her product to market.

We target high yield passive cash flow and long term capital appreciation through strategic acquisition and superior asset management. Kahuna Investments and it's principals have bought, sold and managed over 1,275 units, valued at over $95 million. With over 25 years of real estate combined experience, Kahuna Investments is capitalizing on opportunities created by market conditions to own stabilized multi-family properties in premier locations. Our target properties generate strong, ongoing cash flow income as well as long term wealth potential. Our success and reputation have been built on conservatism, ethics, passion, attention to detail, responsibility, and our belief that trust starts and ends with honesty and integrity.StrategyWhile the market has come back strongly since the Great Recession, our strict investment criteria along with the current economic environment presents a unique opportunity to acquire quality multifamily assets in prime locations at prices which are conservatively underwritten with exciting, yet realistic growth and appreciation expectations. We expect this opportunity to increase in the coming years as climbing interest rates and changing market conditions will force some properties on the market at lower prices. Thus, our strategy is to smartly and patiently acquire, manage and operate stabilized multifamily assets that generate high yield, passive cash flows. We target strong employment centers with growth and stability trends better than the national averages."
