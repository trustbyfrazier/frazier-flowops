This system automates the entire outbound sales process:
- Fetches a list of qualified leads from an external database (Instantly.ai).
- Researches and enriches these leads with company and social media data.
- Uses AI (GPT-4) to write a unique, personalized 3-email sequence for each lead based on the research.
- Sends the emails in a timed sequence (with delays between them).
- Checks for replies before sending follow-ups. If a lead replies, they are marked as such and removed from the sequence.
- Tracks everything in a Google Sheets "Lead Repository" and requires manual approval via Telegram before sending each batch of emails.
